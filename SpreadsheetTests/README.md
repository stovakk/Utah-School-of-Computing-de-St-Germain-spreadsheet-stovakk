The Solution is currently capable of throughlly testing nearly all lines of code in the Spreadsheet test.
Which I feel sufficiently tests the spreadsheet class


Hours Estimated/Worked         Assignment                       Note
         5  /   3    - Assignment 3 - Formula     Spent 2.5 hours writing tests, 2.5 hours debugging

         I believe this would take 5 hours as this is a very extensive project that goes many many lines of code. So
         testing all these lines of code will be very extensive and time consuming. Many exceptions and edge cases exist
         Along with learning how to write stress tests will be tough I assume.

No known bugs or deficiencies, stands on it's own.

Using tests from the GradingTests for assignment 4, outside of that there was no outside help

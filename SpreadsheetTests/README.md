The Solution is currently capable of throughlly testing nearly all lines of code in the Spreadsheet test.
Which I feel sufficiently tests the spreadsheet class


Hours Estimated/Worked         Assignment                       Note
         3  /   3    - Assignment 3 - Formula     Spent 1.5 hours writing tests, 2.5 hours debugging

         I believe this would take 3 hours I think I did good code, however there are bound to be errors. As the class is relatively large and
         has many moving parts that work hand in hand, it will be difficult to find the mistakes. However I think 3 hours is more than
         sufficient. I created all the tests and debugged in 3 hours as it took awhile for me to realize I was calling Dependees instead of Dependents
         in multiple places

No known bugs or deficiencies, stands on it's own.

No outside help

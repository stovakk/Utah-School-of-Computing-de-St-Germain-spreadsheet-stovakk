Hours Estimated/Worked         Assignment                       Note
         4  /   4    - Assignment 3 - Formula     Spent 1.5 hours writing tests, 2.5 hours debugging

         I believe this would take 4 hours I think I did good code, however there are bound to be errors. As the class is relatively large and
         has many moving parts that work hand in hand, it will be difficult to find the mistakes. However I think 4 hours is more than
         sufficient. I did this in 4 hours as it took me awhile for debugging, however the lab this week helped me get faster 
         at debugging and using hotkeys to assist. 

No known bugs or deficiencies, stands on it's own.

Outside help came from lab5 TA helping a bit with the struct

Hours Estimated/Worked         Assignment                       Note
         7    /   8     - Assignment 2 - Dependency Graph      Spent 4 hours on project, 2 creating tests/debugging, 1 documentation

         I believed this would take 8 hours, as I previously believed it would take longer however, I started after class
         on Tuesday in which Professor Jim talked about a mirror data structure that took time out from me thinking about it
         2 hours, intro program, haven't tested yet
         1 hour, switching List to HashSet
         1 hour, finishing replace methods
         2 hours, debugging/tests after learning how to do them in lab3

No known bugs or deficiencies, stands on it's own.

Outside sources contain Professor Jim showing to use a mirror data structure, with two dictionary's

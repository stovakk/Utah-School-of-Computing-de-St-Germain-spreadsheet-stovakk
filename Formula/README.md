The program is currently capable of finding the answer to mathematical expressions which may or may not
contain variables. It calls exceptions when they happen, and can use normalize and valid functions for the 
user's needs.

I believe this project will take me about 10 hours to complete, through reading assignment, coding, and debugging
1 hour reading / doing Formula method
4 hours coding the base
4 hours of debugging

Totalling out a 9 hours for the total assignment, which I see as a good time. I think it would have been faster with a little help 
understanding the struct, however it wasn't bad anyways.

No known bugs or deficiencies, stands on it's own.

I consulted the a website listed below for the syntax of multiple catch's on a try-catch statement and a little help from 
Professor Jim during lectures, but outside of that there was no outside help

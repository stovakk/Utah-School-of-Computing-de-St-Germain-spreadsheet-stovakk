Solution:  DependencyGraphTests
Copyright: CS 3500 and Nate Stovak, 

The Solution is currently capable of throughlly testing all lines of code in the DependencyGraph solution.
Including at the least 3 tests per method, and testing all possible cases for all lines of code


Hours Estimated/Worked         Assignment                       Note
         2  /   3    - Assignment 1 - Formula Evaluator     Spent 1.5 hours writing code, .5 hours debugging code

         I believe this would take 3 hours as I don't yet know how to create tests, and assume there will be a learning 
         curve with some difficulties, along with debugging will take some time even though I am confident with my code
         This solution took me 2 hours to complete as the TA from my lab3 was very helpful and made me understand how to 
         do tests very thuroughlly with little difficulties
         1 hour creating tests
         .5 hours creating tests, .5 hours debugging

No known bugs or deficiencies, stands on it's own.

Outside help came from lab3 TA helping me understand how to test code, outside of that, no help

The Solution is currently capable of evalutaing mathematical expressions and also testing them in many cases
to make sure the evalutation method is correct. Along with the capability to produce a dependency graph of associated
cells when they are implemented


Hours Estimated/Worked         Assignment                       Note
         9.5  /   10    - Assignment 1 - Formula Evaluator     Spent 5 hours fighting Git and Visual Studios
         7    /   8     - Assignment 2 - Dependency Graph      Spent 4 hours on project, 2 creating tests/debugging, 1 documentation

No known bugs or deficiencies, stands on it's own.

I talked to my friend from volleyball, Emma, about delegates along with I believe his name was Samuel, about delegates, from my lab
section. I didn't talk to Professor Jim, however he helped with the lamda expressions for testing 

I need to reference the "Delegate Usage in the Formula Evaluator", as it helped me understand lamda expressions to test delegates
The link is below,

I referenced a Microsoft site to help me find how to evaluate whether a token is in the right for to become a delegate.
Introducing me to the RegexOptions.ignorecase, and to use the @"\w+" to help with the else if statement
for the delegate. The website is listed below

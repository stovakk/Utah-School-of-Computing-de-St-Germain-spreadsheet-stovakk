Solution:  FormulaEvaluator
Copyright: CS 3500 and Nate Stovak, 

The Solution is currently capable of evalutaing mathematical expressions and also testing them in many cases
to make sure the evalutation method is correct. Along with the capability to produce a dependency graph of associated
cells when they are implemented

I believe this project will take me about 10 hours to fully create, and test. It would take me less however I believe
using a new language, delegates which are new to me, and Visual Stuidos/GitHub will take time to get used to. 
This project took me about 9.5 hours to complete the full solution of evaluation and testing. The dependency graph should
take about 8 hours I believe, and I have finished it in about 7 hours

No known bugs or deficiencies, stands on it's own.

I talked to my friend from volleyball, Emma, about delegates along with I believe his name was Samuel, about delegates, from my lab
section. I didn't talk to Professor Jim, however he helped with the lamda expressions for testing 

I need to reference the "Delegate Usage in the Formula Evaluator", as it helped me understand lamda expressions to test delegates

I referenced a Microsoft site to help me find how to evaluate whether a token is in the right for to become a delegate.
Introducing me to the RegexOptions.ignorecase, and to use the @"\w+" to help with the else if statement
for the delegate. The website is listed below

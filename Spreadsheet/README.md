The program is currently capable of creating a new dictionary of cells that together create a basic spreadsheet. It's capabilities
are being able to set cell contents for multiple types of cells, get the names of all non empty cells, what's in any kind of cell, 
and throwing exceptions if there is a wrong input. The program as well can save the spreadsheet, work with previous versions of the 
program with saved files with versioning itself, copy other spreadsheets with a filepath

I believe this project will take me about 10 hours to complete, through reading assignment, coding, and debugging
2 hours reading / understanding inheritance in C# terms/ Whiteboarding
5 hours coding the base
5 hours of debugging/testing

Totalling out a 12 hours for the total assignment, I assumed 10 hours, so I am happy with 11 which I see as a decent time. Nearly all the time came from understanding the 
xml syntax and how to work that, which comes in the save and readfile things

No known bugs or deficiencies, stands on it's own.

I consulted w3 schools to find out about the inheritance, the website is listed below, outside of that all help came from Professor Jim

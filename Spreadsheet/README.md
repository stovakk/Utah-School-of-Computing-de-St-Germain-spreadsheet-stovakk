The program is currently capable of creating a new dictionary of cells that together create a basic spreadsheet. It's capabilities
are being able to set cell contents for multiple types of cells, get the names of all non empty cells, what's in any kind of cell, 
and throwing exceptions if there is a wrong input

I believe this project will take me about 8 hours to complete, through reading assignment, coding, and debugging
1 hour reading / understanding inheritance in C# terms
3 hours coding the base
3 hours of debugging

Totalling out a 7 hours for the total assignment, which I see as a good time. The most time came when thinking about what to do, not actually
implementing code, cell class being the hardest

No known bugs or deficiencies, stands on it's own.

I consulted w3 schools to find out about the inheritance, the website is listed below, outside of that all help came from Professor Jim

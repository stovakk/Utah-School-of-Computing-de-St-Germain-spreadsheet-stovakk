The program is currently capable of finding the answer to mathematical expressions which may or may not
contain variables. Future extensions of my knowledge is to create a spreadsheet using GUI among other implementation 
methods.

I believe this project will take me about 8 hours to complete, I believe the project
is not on the super difficult side. However I will have to get used to Visual Studios which I 
have never used before, and understand how to use a delegate.
After completing the assignment, it has taken me 9 hours to complete. This is due to the difficulty it
took me to understand Visual Studios and how to make the delegate work.

No known bugs or deficiencies, stands on it's own.

I talked to Emma, about delegates, she plays pickup volleyball as well. I talked to a guy I want so say his
name is Samuel in my lab, about delgates.

I referenced a Microsoft site to help me find how to evaluate whether a token is in the right for to become a delegate.
Introducing me to the RegexOptions.ignorecase, and to use the @"\w+" to help with the else if statement
for the delegate. The website is listed below

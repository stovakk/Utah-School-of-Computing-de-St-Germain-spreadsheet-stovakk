The program is currently capable of testing the FormulaEvaluator class to make sure it works as intended. 
There are many test cases to make sure all edge cases work as intended

I believe this project will take me about 2 hours to complete as it is not only writing the code for this class
however, it aslo entails having to debug and rewrite code in the FormulaEvaluator class it is associated with.
This method ended up taking about 1.5 hours to complete as it took about 30 minutes to create all the tests, and an hour to 
debug my code I was testing

No known bugs or deficiencies, stands on it's own.

I talked to no one as there wasn't much to ask about the project, the only question I had was answered in class on Tuesday
by Professor Jim on how to test delegates, however you can use lamda expressions.

I need to reference the "Delegate Usage in the Formula Evaluator", as it helped me understand lamda expressions to test delegates
